To get started with Node.js check our the official docs @ Https://nodejs.org

There you will find the code for a basic and minimal server.

Next we Will add static resource rendering(html, css, client side js.)

     // Some comments
     const http = require('http');

     const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
     const port = 3000;

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World');
    });

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
